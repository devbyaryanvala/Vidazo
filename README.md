# Vidazo Project Documentation üìπ

---

## Overview
**Vidazo** is a **video calling application** developed by devbyaryanvala. It is built to facilitate real-time video communication, leveraging modern web technologies.

---

## Technologies Used
The Vidazo project is primarily developed using:
* **Backend**: üü¢ **Node.js**
* **Frontend**: üìÑ **HTML** and üíª **JavaScript**

This combination suggests a standard web application architecture where Node.js handles server-side logic and real-time communication, while HTML and JavaScript manage the user interface and client-side interactions.

---

## Features
* **Video Calling Functionality**: The core feature of Vidazo is its ability to enable video calls, allowing users to connect and communicate visually in real-time.

---

## Project Structure (Based on observed files)
The repository contains key files that indicate a typical web application structure:
* `app.js`: Likely handles application-level logic or main server setup.
* `index.html`: The main entry point for the client-side user interface.
* `server.js`: Responsible for setting up and managing the Node.js server, including handling connections and potentially WebRTC signaling.

## Setup and Local Execution (General Guidance)
**Please Note**: Detailed, specific instructions for setting up and running *this particular* Vidazo project locally are currently not available in the repository or through external searches. The following are general steps commonly required for Node.js-based WebRTC applications, and you may need to infer specific configurations from the project's source code.

1.  **Clone the Repository**:
    First, you'll need to clone the project from GitHub to your local machine.
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/devbyaryanvala/vidazo.git](https://github.com/devbyaryanvala/vidazo.git)
    ```

2.  **Navigate to the Project Directory**:
    Change your current directory to the cloned project folder.
    ```bash
    cd vidazo
    ```

3.  **Install Dependencies**:
    As a Node.js project, it likely has dependencies listed in a `package.json` file. You would typically install them using npm (Node Package Manager).
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
    *(If a `package.json` file is present in the root, this command should install all required packages.)*

4.  **Run the Server**:
    The presence of `server.js` and `app.js` suggests a Node.js server. You would typically start the server using Node.js.
    ```bash
    node server.js
    ```
    or
    ```bash
    node app.js
    ```
    *(You may need to check the `package.json` for a `start` script, e.g., `npm start`.)*

5.  **Access the Application**:
    Once the server is running, you can usually access the frontend by navigating to `http://localhost:[PORT]` in your web browser. The specific port would be defined within the `app.js` or `server.js` file (commonly 3000, 5000, or 8080).

6.  **WebRTC Considerations**:
    For WebRTC applications, special considerations might include:
    * **STUN/TURN Servers**: For connections across different networks (e.g., behind NATs), STUN (Session Traversal Utilities for NAT) and TURN (Traversal Using Relays around NAT) servers are often necessary. Configuration for these would typically be in the JavaScript code.
    * **HTTPS**: While local development often works over HTTP, real-world WebRTC applications generally require HTTPS for security and browser permissions (e.g., access to camera/microphone).
